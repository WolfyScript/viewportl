## Viewportl
A Minecraft Inventory GUI framework to easily create **powerful, reactive, and efficient Minecraft GUIs**.

![github_commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/WolfyScript/WolfyUtilities)

### Compose
Viewportl uses the Compose Runtime library to make the creation of Minecraft UIs very easy.  

> [!note]
> Jetpack Compose, that you may know from the Android Ecosystem, is build on top of the Compose Runtime.  
> Compose Runtime is a standalone library separate from the Android stack and can be used outside of it.
> Its main goal is to make the creation of dynamic (UI) Trees easy and provides utilities for it.
