## Viewportl
A Minecraft Inventory GUI framework to easily create **reactive, efficient and powerful Minecraft GUIs**.

### Compose
Viewportl uses googles androids compose library to make the creation of Minecraft UIs very easy.  

Compose at its base is just a library to create a tree structure of nodes, the rest of the implementation is part of the viewportl.

### Still in WIP (Alpha)
This project is very much still in early alpha!   
**The API may receive breaking changes at anytime without notice!**

### Planned (TODO)

Now the goal is to get to the same state as the project was in previously.
