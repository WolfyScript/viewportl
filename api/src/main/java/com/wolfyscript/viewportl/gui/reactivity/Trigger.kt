 * A trigger is a simple reactivity node, that can be tracked, and notify its subscribers.
 * It does not contain a value, so it is for cases where a simple update notification and no value is required.
 *
 * To track the trigger inside an Effect/Memo you need to call the [Trigger.track] method inside it.<br>
 * To notify subscribers call the [Trigger.updateIfNecessary] method.
